Client for [api.mineskin.org](https://mineskin.org)

Can be used to generate valid texture data from skin image files.  
You can also use [this online tool]((https://mineskin.org) to directly generate skin data from images.

The API requires official Minecraft accounts to upload the skin textures.  
If you own a Minecraft account you don't actively use and want to contibute to the API's speed, please [contact me](https://inventivetalent.org/contact)!
